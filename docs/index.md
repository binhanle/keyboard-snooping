## Abstract
The problem of keyboard acoustic emanations has shown the possibility of figuring out what a user is typing through keystroke sounds. On the other hand, with the popularity of wearable devices like Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch, more attack vectors might be exploited. In this project, we present and explore a keyboard snooping attack that utilizes keystroke sounds and accelerometer data collected from compromised wearable devices and mobile phones to determine what a user is typing.
